# Codex Profile Launcher for Windows

`Codex-Profile.ps1` launches the normal Codex desktop profile alongside separately isolated profiles.

The current configuration is:

| Profile | Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Work` | Native, default | Launches Codex normally, with no special arguments or environment override. |
| `Personal` | Isolated | Uses separate Codex backend state and Chromium web state. |

Run `Codex-Profile.ps1 -h` or `Codex-Profile.ps1 --help` to see the active configuration.

## Usage

With no arguments, the launcher starts the configured default (`Work`):

```powershell
.\Codex-Profile.ps1
```

These are equivalent:

```powershell
.\Codex-Profile.ps1 Work
.\Codex-Profile.ps1 -Profile Work
```

Launch the isolated personal profile:

```powershell
.\Codex-Profile.ps1 Personal
```

If execution policy blocks the script, use:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Codex-Profile.ps1 Personal
```

The isolated profile defaults to:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexProfiles\personal\codex-home
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexProfiles\personal\web-data
```

`CODEX_HOME` separates Codex authentication, configuration, sessions, databases, skills, and plugins. Chromium `--user-data-dir` separates cookies, local storage, cache, crash data, and desktop web state.

## Change the profiles

Edit the configuration block near the beginning of `Codex-Profile.ps1`:

```powershell
$DefaultProfile = 'Work'
$Profiles = [ordered]@{
    Work     = @{ Mode = 'Native'; Description = 'Normal Codex app state; no profile overrides' }
    Personal = @{ Mode = 'Isolated'; Description = 'Separate personal account and application state' }
}
```

Exactly one profile should normally use `Native` mode because every native entry resolves to the same normal Codex state. Additional accounts should use `Isolated`.

## Create desktop shortcuts

Create one shortcut for every configured profile:

```powershell
.\Codex-Profile.ps1 -InstallShortcuts
```

Do not move or rename the script after creating shortcuts; recreate them if you do.

## Diagnostics

Show running isolated top-level Codex processes:

```powershell
.\Codex-Profile.ps1 -Status
```

The native/default process is deliberately not shown because it has no explicit `--user-data-dir` argument.

## Important caveats

- This was verified with Windows package `OpenAI.Codex_26.707.3748.0_x64` but is not a documented, supported multi-profile feature. A future update could change argument handling, environment handling, authentication, or storage layout.
- Windows still sees every process as the same installed package. Package-scoped settings, notifications, `codex://` protocol activation, shell integration, and OS credential storage may remain shared or route to the wrong profile.
- If browser sign-in returns to the wrong window, temporarily close the other profile, finish sign-in, and reopen both.
- Do not copy credentials between profile folders or place profile data in Git, OneDrive, Dropbox, shared folders, or network drives.
- Do not run the same isolated profile concurrently against the same files. Chromium and SQLite expect single-profile ownership.

## What was verified

On July 10, 2026, a probe launched the packaged `app\ChatGPT.exe` with `CODEX_HOME` and `--user-data-dir` overrides while the normal Codex app was running. Windows created a second top-level process. Its Chromium children used the isolated web-data directory, and its Codex backend initialized config, databases, plugins, and skills under the isolated `CODEX_HOME`.

OpenAI's public documentation does not currently document `--user-data-dir` as a supported Codex desktop profile feature. Treat this launcher as an update-sensitive workaround.
